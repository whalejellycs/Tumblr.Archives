The kingdom employs mostly cast parrots fitting preset molds and dependent on the stochastic parrot. Only a fortunate, mostly hyper rich and leisurely minority of the kingdom&rsquo;s subjects get to be natural, truly unpredictable parrots with brains of their own.</h2><p><br/></p><p>A sure-fire way to execute addition on the numerous social phobic universes below is to consider a mega universe in which we count them up. Another is to consider addition on a temporal dimension, wherein we add one second or some other time unit to another of the same kind. Alternatively still, we can superimpose imagined entities onto these universes and perform the addition from the comfort of an addition-safe universe. Even then, we may choose non-accumulative and non-linear addition methods or be foiled by weird physics and metaphysical determinations. There is a crucial takeaway for us all at the very end.</p><ul><li><b>Dead-cold universe</b></li></ul><p>At its roots, addition comprises either or both of accumulation and contemplation, because it must take place at least in a physical or mental dimension. In a universe with a uniform, theoretical temperature so low that no atomic or subatomic particle moves, no physical change or metabolic process, which is really a series of physical changes, can take place. Such energy states, however, are extremely challenging to attain. Perhaps, the universe will have to be a completely empty universe.</p><ul><li><b>Un</b><b>seen </b><b>uni</b><b>verse, </b><b>un</b><b>imagined </b><b>uni</b><b>verse</b></li></ul><p><i>When you&rsquo;re falling in a forest and there&rsquo;s nobody around<br/>Do you ever really crash, or even </i>ma<i>ke a sound?</i>— Dear Evan Hansen, a Broadway musical</p><p>These lines are a paraphrasing of a philosophical question: Does a tree falling unseen in a forest make a sound? Similarly, do we define addition as a phenomenon in itself or a mental perception? With the latter definition, no addition occurs in an unobserved universe, until at least someone outside the universe contemplates the addition. If the universe itself is fathomed by no one, addition cannot take place at all.</p><p>A remedy is to make any universe fathomable through extreme abstraction.</p><p>Or, perhaps, we can be extreme in our quest for flexibility and settle for the even vaguer notion of theoretical addition pertaining to any ongoings, real or fictional, of any hypothetical universe populated by anything except the lone, indivisible particle. The two added units are defined only by their unbound relatedness to an undefined universe. But how much meaning is there to addition at this level of abstraction beyond repeating the mega universe addition above? And to what extent does it matter if we add up two undefined units in an undefined relationship to an undefined universe or add up two undefined universes?</p><p><br/></p><ul><li><b>We</b><b>ir</b><b>d Time</b></li></ul><p>If ideas like the block universe model of time or the brain-in-a-vat theory are correct, time does not really flow. Past, present and future exist at once in a predetermined gigantic spacetime block forming the universe. You are just a brain fed with artificial memories by the contents of your vat. From an objective point of view then, the passage of 1h+1h=0h. Nevertheless, you may argue that your in-narrative time, by which you understand your static history, counts. There is also the growing block universe model, in which the future is not set in stone.</p><p>What if we adhere to the flowing model of time? Beware of mischievous black holes and time machines then. According to the concept of general relativity, mass warps the spacetime fabric. As ginormously massive objects that potentially rotate very fast, black holes <a href="https://href.li/?https://theconversation.com/are-black-holes-time-machines-yes-but-theres-a-catch-195418#:~:text=Loops%20in%20time&amp;text=A%20black%20hole%20bends%20time,creates%20a%20natural%20time%20machine." target="_blank">can</a> <a href="https://href.li/?https://interestingengineering.com/science/time-machine-using-lasers" target="_blank">twist</a> spacetime so much that it loops back onto itself. Similarly, we can build time machines that take us back in time, through loops or otherwise.</p><p>Time addition in time loops will be similar—but not identical—to modular addition. If we enter a loop at the stage where it has run 7/8 of its cycle and start timing ourselves from there (i.e. time 0 at the 7/8th point, with seven negative time segments before it and one positive time segment after it), we will be at the end of the loop after one time segment and at the 1/8th point of the cycle after another time segment. 1 time segment + 1 time segment = -6 time segments.</p>
