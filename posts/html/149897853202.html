<p style="text-align: justify;">George Eliot <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=LVLppmow9DcC&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=%22If+youth+is+the+season+of+hope%22" target="_blank">wrote</a> in the novel <em>Middlemarch</em> that youth is frequently the season of hope only in the sense that older generations are hopeful about younger ones. Lacking life experiences, young people, for all their physical vitality and cognitive advantages, find each struggle soul-crushing. Likewise, <strong>Age of Youth</strong> (available on <a href="https://www.dramafever.com/drama/4939/Age_of_Youth/" target="_blank">Dramafever</a>) peels back the rosy veneer of life in one's 20s to reveal the socioeconomic difficulties and family/personal tragedies that may afflict young adults without waiting for them to &ldquo;grow up&rdquo; first. Its oldest main character, college senior Yoon Jin-myung, already 28, is forever too busy making ends meet to properly experience the springtime of her life. Fake college student Kang Yi-na, 24, escapes from a near-death experience only to lead a wasted life hooking up with rich men in bars for an indulgent lifestyle out of survivor guilt. Princessy Jung Ye-eun (pictured above), 22, can hardly bring herself to break up with her atrocious boyfriend. Dirty-talking liar Song Ji-won, also 22, ironically seems to be the most well-adjusted and one of the wisest among the pack. Timid Yoo Eun-jae, only 20, may have been a murderess. With courage and companionship, though, it may still be possible to live life to the fullest, in spite of scars and missteps, making these truly beautiful years of their lives.</p>
