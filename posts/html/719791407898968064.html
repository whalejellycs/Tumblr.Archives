And the lore woven among your inner selves might well claim that you need to have rescued 10 amphibian universes in your past life to be consistently recognized as a well-meaning creature or gain the elusive keys to everyone&rsquo;s heart. </p><p>To be a gnome or a fairy, during the moments you can only be one?</p><p>To be seen as a presumably spiteful gnome but unseen for its benevolence or seen as a fairy, when the madding crowd would only see you as one?</p><p>Gnomehood is underrated. Fairyhood offers a longer lifespan for you to do good.</p><p>But, at the very least, don&rsquo;t miss out on gnome living just because our fairy wings are lost, deformed or bleeding or have never been born.</p></blockquote>
<p class="npf_quirky">Responses from the non-human realm (Edited)<br/><br/>1. Elf sidekick</p><p>Your words have been wise - as much as any fairy. [Editor: *Blushes profusely*]</p><p>Gnome living is still living, and a life well-lived is still to be appreciated.</p><p>And maybe our wings will one day regrow, and we&rsquo;ll be even more magical than before.</p><p><br/></p><p class="npf_quirky">2. Pumpkin-knitting cousin in eternal summer</p><p>I believe that the best way to do good in the world is to be yourself. While it may be tempting to pine for traits or characteristics that are seemingly out of reach, the key is to embrace one&rsquo;s own unique qualities and find ways to use them for good. </p><p>If you&rsquo;re a gnome, then be proud of it! Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you that you can&rsquo;t do good because you&rsquo;re not a fairy. Gnomes have just as much to offer the world as fairies do.</p><p><br/></p><p class="npf_quirky">3. Simulated realist</p><p>The keys to everyone&rsquo;s hearts may be more of a burden than a gift. Holding the keys to someone&rsquo;s heart can create a power imbalance in a relationship. It can also be overwhelming to keep other people&rsquo;s feelings in mind at all times and to make sure that you&rsquo;re not causing any harm. Without people doing the same around, this can lead to feelings of isolation. Don&rsquo;t envy the fairies. Support them wherever you can.</p><p><br/></p><p class="npf_quirky">4. Supreme exterminator</p><p>Gnomes, fairies, gods, and mortals… it makes no difference. In the eyes of Eternity, they are all equally mortal. In the face of change, they are all equally brittle. In the pursuit of Eternity, they are nothing more than pawns to be used, or obstacles to be overcome.</p><p><br/></p><p class="npf_quirky">Responses from the human realm (Predicted)</p><p class="npf_quirky">1. Productivity optimizer</p><p>If you have all the time in the world to do good, you won&rsquo;t feel the urgency to. The probable time complacence of long-living species offsets their chances to do good. Setting time limits for yourself is crucial in any task. Now excuse me while I get back to the spreadsheets atop my treadmill desk.</p><p><br/></p><p class="npf_quirky">2. Involution coach</p><p>In this hyper-competitive corporate landscape, it&rsquo;s no longer enough to have an I- or T-shaped skill set. You need a pi-, or better still, comb-shaped skill set. Take classes in not only Gnome and Fairy but also Raccoon and Squirrel. </p><p>No, take that back. You need a hedgehog-shaped skill set. Make sure your Gnome, for example, includes Gnochemistry, Gnomadic Languages, Gnormosity Engineering and more. And your Gnomadic Languages must cover ancient Gnomadic epics, recent Gnomadic pop sensations on Tik Tok and Gnomadic computing.</p><p>Yes, I have a fondness for Māori art. In fact, my lifelong dream is a space sculpture where the patterns run from a galaxy scale all the way down to the nanoscale. Why do you ask?</p><p><br/></p><p class="npf_quirky">3. Clueless media executive</p><p>That reminds me. There&rsquo;s still room in the market for Love Between Fairy And Gnome. We just need to excise the features posing product risks: the red-hat-blue-shirt thingy, the vertically challengedness and the white beard. There, we can now cast Handsome Oppar in the role.</p><p><br/></p><p class="npf_quirky">4. Cynic</p><p>LMAO. You mean, who&rsquo;re the better hypocrites? Impostors or would-be demagogues?</p><p><br/></p><p class="npf_quirky">5. Crystal ball-gazing, amphibious techie</p><p>Yo. Does no one see what I see? Talk about arms races. We&rsquo;re heading towards a wings race and a synthetic wings divide. Bionic wings. Genetically engineered wings. Wing stem cell transplants. When advanced enough, the post-gnome age will let the well-heeled buy the facade of niceness. Give full wings to the humanities first.</p>
