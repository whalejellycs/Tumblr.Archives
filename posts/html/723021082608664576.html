It&rsquo;s our fault that the system controls were not fully in place, but I do expect meticulousness from my psychologists.</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate who majored in human psychology:</span></p><p>My pronouns are they/them.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>Ah! I really have to tell the technical team to update the form. I have absolutely no problem with your gender identity or your species. But you only have textbook and secondhand insights into human psychology.</p><p>Unlike human psychologists, you don&rsquo;t know what it feels on the inside to be human. Observations and textbook knowledge don&rsquo;t tell you everything. Many things are left unspoken.</p>[[MORE]]<p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>While I cannot pretend to know exactly how it feels to be a human, I am willing to work as hard as I can to try to understand the complexities of the human mind and heart, perhaps even harder than the average human candidate. Through studying human literature, observing my own relationships with humans, and developing a strong emotional bond with my human friends and classmates, I have already developed a deep appreciation and understanding of the human psyche that goes beyond mere textbook knowledge or casual observations. While there are certain aspects of the human experience that I do not share, I am confident that my empathy and dedication to the field of psychology more than make up for any lack of firsthand experience.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>Why should I recruit you when I can just recruit a human top scorer with the same grades? </p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>While a human with the same qualifications may also have a great understanding of humans, they are likely to be inherently biased by their own perspective. I, however, also have the advantage of being able to objectively analyze humans&rsquo; strengths, weaknesses, and motivations from an outsider perspective.</p><p>Additionally, as a member of a paranormal race, I have the ability to manipulate human minds and feelings to improve mental well-being.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>Mind manipulation? By now, you&rsquo;re stark raving bonkers! How do I know you won&rsquo;t put it to bad use?</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>As a vampire, I understand the importance of being self-aware and responsible when it comes to my ability to manipulate the emotions and actions of others. I take care to only use this power in situations where it is necessary or beneficial, and to never misuse it for personal gain or at the expense of others. I also make sure to seek consent before using my ability on individuals, and I always prioritize their safety, comfort, and well-being.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d say of course. I have no reason to trust you.</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>I understand your skepticism and reticence. In a world dominated by humans, it is often difficult for vampires like myself to be seen as anything other than predators or manipulative. However, while it may be challenging, this does not mean that it is impossible for you to trust me. In the end, trust is built through communication and understanding, which is why I have been open and honest with you about my ability to manipulate minds and my intentions in using this ability. </p><p>Trust is also earned over time. I think if you give me a chance to prove myself on the job, with ample supervision at the start, you will be able to put aside your hesitations about working with a vampire by and by. The best way to find out if i&rsquo;m good at my job is not through urban legends, groundless hearsay or unscientific mob opinion but to give me a shot and see how things work out.</p><p>I can even agree to a contract outlining specific guidelines for how I will use my vampire abilities, and what steps we can take to ensure that my mind manipulation is always used in a beneficial way.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>Hmmm. Excellent pitch. But it sounds too good to be true. For one thing, I need to review the clinical evidence and adverse effects records later. And why should I be the first to hire a vampire as a psychologist? I prefer someone tried and tested.</p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7554f117f0fa7d9c367e1a621e168952/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-26/s640x960/a08d747bd10ac554e15972bd6aae4e8103613243.jpg" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1024" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/7554f117f0fa7d9c367e1a621e168952/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-26/s75x75_c1/63cac88d0188fdb5b2c6cae43963256704ae4763.jpg 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7554f117f0fa7d9c367e1a621e168952/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-26/s100x200/bbcc66699c446524d1aeec29d5c589f081c4d4ce.jpg 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7554f117f0fa7d9c367e1a621e168952/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-26/s250x400/889ceaedd6f65fc45a7dd27f77328507e6a6e5c8.jpg 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7554f117f0fa7d9c367e1a621e168952/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-26/s400x600/ed2549c864a5c59a2da77a41abb0fbe0ae79ea16.jpg 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7554f117f0fa7d9c367e1a621e168952/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-26/s500x750/f2886e68172c2546c205b905d036f687c928c82e.jpg 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7554f117f0fa7d9c367e1a621e168952/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-26/s540x810/a3c4824b2c780c56f8d346183520630ba22d0309.jpg 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7554f117f0fa7d9c367e1a621e168952/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-26/s640x960/a08d747bd10ac554e15972bd6aae4e8103613243.jpg 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/7554f117f0fa7d9c367e1a621e168952/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-26/s1280x1920/b4a926586c10de6cef38f605a7dc087f5fe4874f.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></figure></div><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>If you would like to work with experienced practitioners, that is certainly your prerogative. However, it is often beneficial to have a fresh perspective on a problem, and working with a vampire psychologist can provide that. Please consider what I have to offer.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>It&rsquo;s true. We have clients who remain unyielding to all the therapy regimes out there. Psychology has improved by leaps and bounds but is still an inexact science. We do need fresh ideas.</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>Please also remember other positive traits of the vampire race. For example, I can live for millennia in the absence of mishaps. During my long lifespan, I can examine numerous times more clients than human colleagues are capable of. The synergistic effect of that extensive experience and my unique perspective will empower me to generate breakthroughs in therapeutic innovations.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>Cool, but the manner in which you&rsquo;re comparing yourself against your human colleagues before you even start your job is concerning. Psychologists are not melodramatic lone heroes. We often need to engage in teamwork with one another in order to serve clients in a therapeutic setting. This can be in the form of team discussions about a client&rsquo;s treatment plan or case, collaboration on the research of a particular issue or hypothesis, or even simply supporting each other as we help clients through treatment. Are you sure you&rsquo;ll be a good team player?</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>That is a valid point. I apologize for the misimpression. While professional independence is important, collaboration and teamwork are equally essential. I don&rsquo;t view my vampire heritage as something that makes me better or worse than my colleagues, it&rsquo;s simply a part of who I am and a source of unique strengths and flaws. As a member of the greater psychological community, I am committed to collaborating with my colleagues to help our clients in the best possible way. Thank you for the reminder to be a supportive team player.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>OK. A critical question: HOW do I know you won&rsquo;t succumb to the temptation of your overworked co-workers&rsquo; and vulnerable clients&rsquo; blood? You may have excellent grades for your degrees in human psychology, but what about vampire psychology? I can risk neither the life of whichever assessor I assign for your probationary period nor those of all the appointees you see in the reception area outside, who have entrusted their welfare to our practice.</p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/775410f959189cfcd288a714cb3aa49f/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-11/s640x960/0546737e5ec308ca4dd306556d2286bba949755f.jpg" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1024" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/775410f959189cfcd288a714cb3aa49f/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-11/s75x75_c1/ee0c511d4f42051ac7076be9264f223d18f0c678.jpg 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/775410f959189cfcd288a714cb3aa49f/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-11/s100x200/99ee8c03f4b9f12a20f340ebfa017d66c9246998.jpg 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/775410f959189cfcd288a714cb3aa49f/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-11/s250x400/fd03b58da8af6ca82ba2df46b495b3d6c929e09f.jpg 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/775410f959189cfcd288a714cb3aa49f/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-11/s400x600/9c467220888f5c8868fc7830f8d6386ca55712c2.jpg 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/775410f959189cfcd288a714cb3aa49f/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-11/s500x750/158bd8485da63d77378f6d99586791b2668f7dbe.jpg 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/775410f959189cfcd288a714cb3aa49f/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-11/s540x810/ae1376799b53badeb173e81d60f5b04005dcdc73.jpg 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/775410f959189cfcd288a714cb3aa49f/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-11/s640x960/0546737e5ec308ca4dd306556d2286bba949755f.jpg 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/775410f959189cfcd288a714cb3aa49f/4b7a34c2b25d5cb0-11/s1280x1920/219b1a659560161d1a750e8f0605463bb7abdbc2.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></figure></div><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>I can understand that the possibility of a vampire drinking human blood is a concern, especially in a field like psychology that works so closely with humans. However, you have nothing to worry about in that regard. I have testimonials from my professors—</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>Ah, yes. But the academic world is nothing like the messy real world of full-time working adults. Our educational system in Typingland is so infantile it requires hardly any practical experience like internships to earn a PsyD. Your self-control may be stretched to its limits by manipulative patients, vitriolic parents and unsuccessfully forestalled suicides, although I must say most clients in our practice are incredibly sweet in spite of their personal difficulties.</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>The work of psychologists is indeed strenuous. Nevertheless, my lifestyle has given me a strong foundation for coping with the stress.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>The lifestyle of a vampire?</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>As a vampire, I understand that I have certain physical and psychological needs, but I have taken many steps to ensure that these are met in a safe and ethical way that don&rsquo;t involve living humans. My physical needs can be met through a diet of donated blood, while my emotional needs can be met through strong professional boundaries, self-care practices, and maintaining a strong support network. </p><p>I regularly engage in personal wellness practices such as meditation and physical activity to maintain my emotional and mental vitality. I also check in with my psychologist for vampires at least once a month, adjusting the frequency with the stress I experience and the intensity of the blood thirst at any given time. This helps to provide a safe space for me to express and process my thoughts, feelings, and experiences. It also gives me the opportunity to practice managing my blood thirst through a variety of behavioral and mindfulness techniques.</p><p>If you would like, I can arrange for my psychologist to send you an evaluation report.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>I&rsquo;m deeply impressed. (Claps and shakes head in awe.) I must say that I&rsquo;ve never met a candidate, human or vampire, with your level of dedication. Quite a number of the psychologists I know <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-everyday-unconscious/202005/should-therapists-have-therapist-yes-now-more-ever" target="_blank">have undergone</a> depression themselves in the course of this emotionally draining and underpaid work but were late in seeking professional intervention. They need to learn a thing or two from newbies like you.</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>Oh, why, thank you!</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>However—I&rsquo;m afraid our clientele and the public won&rsquo;t share my sentiments. </p><p>You may think I&rsquo;ve been demanding and prejudiced, but the others? They won&rsquo;t even sit down like this to sift through your personal history or examine your well-crafted arguments. Public attention to the fanciful layers and facets, okay, just layers and facets, to marginalized demographics like yours has been fleeting to start with and pretty much vaporized in a Tiktokified economy. Social media?? It&rsquo;s a wasteland made up of countless virtual enclaves out there. Every phone zombie just scrolls past news and advocacy messages that don&rsquo;t amuse them or address their own problems. And algorithms?? Gawd! Don&rsquo;t. Even. Get. Me. Started. On. Algorithms.</p><p>What people out there will get with their precious microseconds for us, though, is that our practice is employing a dangerous and powerful person, if they would even see you as a person at all, to work on fragile humans in despair.</p><p>Look, we don&rsquo;t need bloody fangs and the bat wing stuff to further complicate the ongoing uphill battle of getting psychological condition sufferers to walk through our doors. </p><p>Welp &hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry for my bluntness. I tend to let down my guard when I&rsquo;m not in front of clients. You&rsquo;re a fine young vampire who deserves better.</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>(Momentary silence.)</p><p>Those are indeed tough challenges. How about this? Let&rsquo;s start by offering virtual sessions for clients who would feel more comfortable initially meeting with me through a video conference. This can help to gradually introduce me to them in a non-threatening environment and allow them to get to know me better before they agree to meet in person.</p><p>We can complement that with an on-site &ldquo;try-out&rdquo; session for clients who remain hesitant to work with me or lack technological access or digital literacy. A try-out session could involve a brief, low-stakes meeting where clients can meet me, ask questions, and get a sense of my approach before deciding whether to continue with therapy. This can help to build trust and rapport with them, and give them a chance to see that I am interested in helping them and can provide effective treatment.</p><p>As we graduate to proper therapy sessions and make good progress on cases, we can highlight statistics, success stories and testimonials from past clients who have worked with me, and emphasize my ability to provide effective treatment. That is, with their consent and proper anonymization of course. Given your practice&rsquo;s reputation for integrity, the credibility of anonymized feedback should not be a problem.</p><p>Perhaps, I can even make up for the reputation risk at the beginning by offering fun, one-of-a-kind indoor levitation experiences that are a soother of the nerves and a break from the mundaneness of everyday life. The experiences would also attract potential clients otherwise resistant to treatment because of public perceptions of psychotherapists as rigid doctrine-driven professionals, who they think won&rsquo;t understand their unique struggles and decision rationale, like reasons for investing all their time in an unstable line of work or sticking with a violent spouse. They are stress relievers no one can find in self-help books or chat responses from even the best of AI technology!</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>W—ow. I&rsquo;m tempted to try that levitation myself. I have to think about your proposals and discuss them with the others. </p><p>There&rsquo;s just one last thing that I don&rsquo;t understand, and anyone, whatever the temperature of their blood, can sense this coming from miles away.</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>Please go ahead.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>Why a career in human psychology? Wouldn&rsquo;t you face less discrimination and be more at home with vampire psychology?</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Vampire graduate:</span></p><p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by humans and their unique abilities to adapt and survive without paranormal powers, especially the human capacity for empathy. It&rsquo;s been my dream since I was young to study the human mind, to explore the depths of their emotions and figure out what truly motivates them.</p><p>Many people think that clinical counselling is about entering broken minds, but it is simultaneously about tapping the power of the marvelous human stores of mental resilience, mental flexibility and boundless optimism.</p><p>The wonders and possibilities of human psychology energize me. They keep me going every day despite the uncertainties of my chosen career path and the suspicion and taunts I get. I am one of those who believe that you can flourish in the long term only if you are emotionally invested in what you do.</p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Human recruiter:</span></p><p>Even if you don&rsquo;t end up on our team, I have no regrets taking time to interview you.
