                    Hello Eusong. This is the admin of Dinner Talk With The A-Philosopher&#039;s Chair, a site which has recently launched a suicide prevention campaign. If you find it useful, kindly share the news with your friends or recommend a book, play or screen production that encourages the choice of life over death. Recommended works need not be fiction or from any particular continent, but should preferably contain no proselytizing content. Thank you for your time.                    </div>
