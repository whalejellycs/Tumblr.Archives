The year is 2077. The world is a very different place than it was just a few decades ago. Climate change has ravaged the planet, and many cities have been abandoned due to rising sea levels. In the midst of this chaos, a new type of hospital has emerged: the <b>glutinous hospital</b>.</p>[[MORE]]<p>Glutinous hospitals are not like traditional hospitals. They are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical technology, and they do not have a staff of highly trained doctors and nurses. Instead, glutinous hospitals are staffed by a group of unlikely heroes: spirits of <b>tangyuan</b>.</p><p>Tangyuan are small, round, and sweet dumplings made from glutinous rice flour. They are also very kind and compassionate. They have a natural ability to heal the sick and injured, and they are always willing to help those in need.</p><p>One day, a young woman named Xiao Yu (originally Xiaolanhua) arrives at a glutinous hospital. She is suffering from a terminal illness, and she has been given only a few months to live. Xiao Yu is desperate for a cure, and she is willing to try anything.</p><p>The tangyuan at the glutinous hospital are able to heal Xiao Yu&rsquo;s illness. They give her a new lease on life, and they help her to find her true purpose in the world. Xiao Yu eventually becomes a doctor at the glutinous hospital, and she dedicates her life to helping others.</p><p>However, there is a dark side to this convalescent planet retaken by fantasy. The tangyuan are not the only ones who can heal the sick and injured. There are also a group of creatures known as the <b>colorful qilins</b> who have the same ability. They look like horses with the head of a dragon, the body of a deer, and the tail of an ox and are often seen as symbols of hope and redemption. In reality, though, the colorful qilins use their powers to harm and destroy.</p><p>One day, a group of colorful qilins attack the glutinous hospital. They kill many of the tangyuan, and they take Xiao Yu prisoner. Xiao Yu is forced to work for the colorful qilins, and she is used to heal their injured soldiers.</p><p>Xiao Yu is horrified by what she is forced to do, but she knows that she must obey the colorful qilins if she wants to stay alive. She also knows that she must find a way to escape and to stop the colorful qilins from hurting anyone else.</p><p>Xiao Yu eventually escapes from the colorful qilins, and she returns to the glutinous hospital. She helps the tangyuan to rebuild the hospital, and she vows to never let the colorful qilins hurt anyone again.</p><p>However, Xiao Yu is also haunted by the memories of the things she has seen and done while working for the colorful qilins. Despite all of this, she never gives up hope and remains determined to make a difference. </p><p>But another wrench has been thrown into the works. The tangyuan are not as kind and compassionate as they seem. They are actually quite selfish and manipulative, and they use Xiao Yu for their own purposes.</p><p>Xiao Yu eventually realizes this, and she is heartbroken. She realizes that she has been lied to and used, and she doesn&rsquo;t know who to trust anymore.</p><p>Xiao Yu eventually leaves the glutinous hospital, and she sets out on her own. She doesn&rsquo;t know where she&rsquo;s going or what she&rsquo;s going to do, but she knows that she can&rsquo;t stay there any longer. She travels the world while she figures out her future, helping those in need and fighting for what she believes in. In the seemingly never-ending journey, she becomes a symbol of hope and inspiration for others.</p><p>Xiao Yu&rsquo;s character trajectory is a long and difficult one. She is faced with many challenges, and she often feels lost and alone. However, she never gives up hope. She knows that she is strong and capable, and she is determined to find her own way in the world.</p><p>Her story is a story about the power of the human spirit. It is also a story about the dangers of false hope and the importance of finding your own way in the world. It shows that even the most seemingly benevolent creatures can have dark secrets, and that even the most seemingly innocent people can be corrupted by power. In it, one witnesses the dangers of idealism and the importance of critical thinking.</p><p><br/></p><p>Image generated through WOMBO.</p>
