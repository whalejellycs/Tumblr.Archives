                    Hi, This is Hazelle from The Asian Drama Philosopher (A-Philosopher)&rsquo;s Chair, a site that provides weekly analyses of literature, art and ideas featured in K/J/TW/CN dramas. I am currently interviewing Asian drama bloggers for a year-end special on my site. My question is simple: If you were to compare a C-drama and a TW-drama of your choice to a magic spell each, which dramas and spells would they be? Thanks!                    </div>
                    <p>Hi Hazelle! What an interesting question! :)) OK I’m not familiar with magic spells at all but <b><i>Nirvana in Fire</i></b> definitely casted a (or many) spells on me - whether it’s my inability to keep my eyes off the screen for hours&hellip;. or it just completely changed my opinion on Chinese historials. I never thought I’d love it so much but at the end of it, I just wanted to watch more! :) </p><p><br/></p><p>Happy Holidays!</p>
