                    <h2>Admin’s Message: Hello Tumblr followers, thank you for reading <a href="https://aphilosopherchair.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">The Asian Drama Philosopher (A-Philosopher)’s Chair</a> all this while!  As a special treat for everyone, the Chair is inviting bloggers from different backgrounds to share their views on the relationship between culture and drama writing. First up is well-known K-drama commentator <a href="https://twitter.com/samsooki" target="_blank">samsooki</a>, who is of Korean heritage.

by samsooki</p><p>Well, you know it was coming.  It is episode 12 or 13 of your favorite
k-drama romcom, after all.  The other
kdrama shoe known as “noble idiocy,” must drop.</p><p><b>The Setup</b>.  It has taken a dozen heart-tugging
episodes, and a half of a lifetime from the time they attended the same
elementary school, but the protagonists (let’s pick names – Bob and Mary) have
defeated both (a) the evil scheming uncle who wants to take over the chaebol
board of directors, and (b) the crazy ex-boyfriend/girlfriend who won’t take no
for an answer.  After weeks of Wed-Thurs
cliffhangers, Bob and Mary have finally become the OTP (One True Pairing) that
we always hoped would happen!  Ooooh, but
what twist hath fate wrought upon our starstruck couple!  The protagonists suddenly find themselves in
a quandary – an unexpected and inexorable something (probably a dormant cancer,
orphanage secret, and/or a chaebol proxy fight) is standing in the way of their
happiness ever after!  What, if anything,
can be done?<br/></p><p><b>The Western Solution</b>.  From
a Western structural standpoint, the path toward Bob’s and Mary’s resolution
includes:  (1) forthright communication,
(2) working together to assuage each other’s fears, (3) gaining mutual strength
for the Final Showdown, and (4) ending the cycle of individual misdirection by
forgiveness and trust.  Seems pretty
self-explanatory, doesn’t it?  All they
have to do is work together!<br/></p><p><b>The K-Drama Response</b>.
Noooo, we must be far more complicated.
Bob and Mary must be cliven asunder by a unilateral and preemptive decision
made by one of them as a dramatic score plays in the background, followed by heartbreaking
preview scenes of “why isn’t he/she answering my texts” angst.  The first of Bob and Mary to blink away his
or her single, pretty tear must leave Korea, forever, or at least a very long
time.  Further, there must not be any
further communication of any kind for at least a year, perhaps three.  Finally, each must suffer and cry alone while
reminiscing through montage clips, wondering if fate will be kinder in future
lifetimes.  And in the end, what appeared
to be a noble effort to cause less pain, has now caused more, idiotically.  Let the sardonic eye-rolls, the knowing sighs
of disbelief and cynical anti-tropist over-reaction commence.  Yes indeed, it is the kdrama trope of <b>noble idiocy</b>.<br/></p><p>Surely, the kdrama’s PD (the production
director) and the writers can do better?
But maybe, what we believe to be a crutch for unoriginal writing isn’t
what we think it is at all.  Perhaps the
writers are merely introducing and then reinforcing an Asian principle that
Koreans have long since internalized.</p><p><b>What is going on here?</b><i> </i> </p><p>a.             
<b>Western
Perspective – Y’all Are Noble Idiots</b>.  The Western view, of
course, is based on perspectives heavily influenced by individualism and
discrete ethics.  In the Western view,
each person is responsible for his or her actions and no more.  The Westerner would look at Bob’s silly
actions and argue that, even if Bob initially believed that his own happiness
would be greater if Mary is not burdened by Bob’s problems, how can Bob leaving
the country without a word to Mary be the proper method for achieving such
happiness?  And if Bob were acting in
such a way for Mary’s happiness, surely Bob would not believe that he would be
making Mary happier if he left her in a frozen state of uncertainty for years,
perhaps forever? Pure madness and counter-productive!</p><p>b.             <b>
Korean Perspective
– You Don’t Understand Our Worldview</b>. Surely, then, Koreans
with their 5,000 year history, would know better by now!  Hmm, perhaps they do, though?  By way of background - the Korean worldview
is framed by a Confucian philosophy integrally woven into every part of Korean
society.  On whatever level, the general
principle is the same – <i>a person’s
highest duty is to take responsibility for those who follow such person</i>.  This is true of familial relationships
(parent to child, spouse to spouse, sibling to sibling), educational and corporate
relationships (seniors to juniors) and political governance (ruler to subjects)
as well.  This worldview dominates Korean
thinking.  It is the reason why one’s age
is so important, and why honorifics are critical to conversation, even between
family members.  One must always know who
should be taking responsibility for whom, and likewise, who should be following
and who should be leading.  It is the
reason that students address one another by titles like <b>sunbae</b> (one’s senior) and <b>hoobae</b>
(one’s junior) and that words like <b>oppa</b>
and <b>noona</b> mean so much more than
their literal meaning.  Family,
friendships, corporations and even nations are held together by this principle
of taking responsibility for those who follow you.  Is it any shock that this principle also
applies between lovers as well?</p><p>Of course, one can argue that romantic
relationships should not necessarily follow the Confucian philosophy,
especially not in the post-modern age.
My counter is that as true as that argument might be, Bob and Mary are
not yet a couple at this stage in the kdrama.  As such, each of Bob and Mary is likely to
fall back upon traditional relational notions to deal with the other of them.</p><p>Taken to its logical conclusion then, Bob
cannot simply ask Mary to (1) share in the burden of the obstacle, and (2) work
together to deal with the OTP crisis.  Such
a request would be nigh on unthinkable because one of Bob or Mary must take
responsibility for the other, and cannot share or delegate such duty.  And this kind of relationship is not unique
to Eastern philosophies.  The concept
that certain duties cannot be delegated is not just an Eastern concept, but it
is part of the bedrock of Western jurisprudence as well.  A fiduciary duty is the highest level of
obligation that a person can owe to another – and such obligation cannot be shared.  Just as an agent must act solely for the
benefit of the principal, and a trustee cannot halve his liability by
delegating half of his duties, Bob cannot breach his obligation to Mary.</p><p>It would be alarming then, for Bob, in the
face of an obstacle that appears unsolvable without the help of Mary, to confess
his burdens to Mary.  If Bob were to
share his burdens with Mary, Bob would be abdicating his role as Mary’s
protector.  Bob cannot have it both ways
– if Bob has any designs on remaining the kind of person that Mary could rely
upon, Bob cannot ask for help from Mary.
Taken on a macro level, such an action would turn society upside down.  Bob’s only choice, therefore, if indeed Bob
is the one who takes responsibility for the problems besetting our OTP of
choice, is to remove himself from the situation entirely.  </p><p>Note that this is not because Bob thinks any
of the problems is insurmountable and will inevitably hurt Mary, but because he
believes he is not (yet) strong enough to deal with the issue. Note as well that even if Mary also stepped up
and declared responsibility for Bob, each of Bob and Mary would be forced to
take action unilaterally because of the impossibility of sharing duties under
the Confucian way of thinking.</p><p>In Korean thinking, harmony in society, whether
on a macro or micro level, depends upon the ability of those who take
responsibility for others.  The good
leader will cause his or her nation to prosper, and the good parent will cause
her children to become good adults.
Likewise, the person who capably wears his or her mantle of leadership will
permit harmony to exist within the relationship.  And it is within this context of harmony that
love can truly exist and flourish.<br/></p><p>Hope that helps quell the anger of anti-tropists
out there seeking another noble idiot to skewer!</p>
