<blockquote><p>#kdramawomensweek (2023)  and - day eight, timeslip [what if two female characters from different dramas…could meet?]</p><p>one of the ways fiction fails women is with its failure of imagination for what our lives can be. this failure comes in many ways:</p><ul><li>our social roles limited to being mothers, wives, and daughters</li><li>a lack of subjectivity, as in stories are not told so that the reader or viewer is invited into the experience of them through point of view of a woman; or a woman’s experience is not a legitimate or accessible or interesting mode of storytelling</li><li>our experiences limited to being fuck-able, rape-able, beautiful, cisgendered, but not in a way that affords subjectivity (see above)</li><li>and more</li></ul><p>one of the things i’ve always enjoyed about kdramas is their preoccupation with modes of living. they ask the questions:</p><ul><li>how do people live?</li><li>why do they live this way?</li><li>what is hard about living?</li><li>what threatens how people choose to live?</li><li>how do you live alongside others?</li></ul><p>last night i browsed through part 2 of the glory and one minor character, the old lady landlord, reminded me of another from a very different drama, age of youth—the old lady landlord. </p><figure data-orig-width="2560" data-orig-height="1600" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a6ede7bfbadd1d1370acb1a9d77df2bf/3ceb662847804e1f-35/s540x810/ed9fe9e73dbdd470ba9653d692c344abf8bc1943.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="2560" data-orig-height="1600"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="1136" data-orig-height="559" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ecbddd8f1b69bd4fae0f6e012da5a949/3ceb662847804e1f-a5/s540x810/2b483d6f64a3c30e5a3000f6cf3f7171da9d594a.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1136" data-orig-height="559"/></figure><p>[image cr: <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/lil98s/709681495581835264?source=share" target="_blank">lil98s</a>]</p><p>the glory is a soapy, improbable revenge drama, while age of youth is a coming of age slice of life. i think the breadth between the two shows illustrates what i’m trying to understand about why i’m so charmed by both these women. they’re both old, unmarried or otherwise partner-free, without children (the one from the glory lost her child), financially independent, and able to offer housing and safety to younger women. my favorite thing, though, is that they both grow gardens on the rooftops of their homes. how lovely is that? to imagine an old woman not only as someone’s grandmother, or living with illness, or confined to a home, or as someone’s caretaker, but as a free person with her own place, with the leisure to garden and the power to offer homes to younger people. and both of these women are able to exist in such vastly different stories.</p><p>the other thing i love about kdramas is how they open up my own imagination. i tend to get stuck in the rut of surviving from day to day—go to work, pay my bills, deal with my body, live as [list identities here] in [list society here] with [list family bullshit here]. but when i saw the old lady landlord last night i had a spark of imagination—wouldn’t it be neat if that’s what my future held? she, and the old lady landlord of age of youth, made me stop and think about my own mode of living, and what my life can be, happily, when i’m old. </p></blockquote> </div>
