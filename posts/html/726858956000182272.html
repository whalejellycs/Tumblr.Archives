The few remaining cities were overcrowded and chaotic, and resources were scarce. Soot from all the firestorms still blocked out sunlight, while enemies might strike again at any time.</p><p>In one of these cities, a man named Adam was trying to board a lorry to get necessities for his parents and children, all of them on the autism spectrum like himself. He had been finding transportation for hours, and he was starting to get frustrated.</p>[[MORE]]<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an autistic caregiver,&rdquo; he said to the soldiers guarding the lorry. &ldquo;I need to get on board to get food and medicine for my parents and children, who are autistic too.&rdquo;</p><p>The soldiers looked bored. &ldquo;We have many families with autistic children in this city,&rdquo; one of them replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Please, I mean I am also an autistic person myself. My sensory issues mean I need to stay warm more than others as I fetch necessities for my family. I cannot be trekking in this frozen wasteland for too long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, I hear you correctly now. But what&rsquo;s a person with special needs doing out in the open right now? Hunker down in your bunker and tell your family to run their own errands.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, you heard me correctly. They are also autistic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So your kids are the ones who&rsquo;re autistic?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am, too.&rdquo;</p><p>The soldiers still didn&rsquo;t understand. &ldquo;How can an autistic person be a caregiver?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is difficult but necessary,&rdquo; Adam said. &ldquo;Autism often runs in the family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Poor thing. The mother didn&rsquo;t survive the bombings? Get the kids&rsquo; grandparents to help out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like I&rsquo;ve said before, they&rsquo;re autistic themselves. Their symptoms have been worsening with age. They&rsquo;re practically deaf to vehicle horns, and their bodies feel like rumpled bags of broken bones.&rdquo;</p><p>The soldiers shook their heads. &ldquo;Come up with a more believable multigenerational sad-sack story, dude. I don&rsquo;t even know autistic people have girlfriends in peacetime, let alone in war and breeding till now. At most, you&rsquo;re either just autistic or just a caregiver and neither would make you so special,&rdquo; one of them said.</p><p>&ldquo;Get your facts right before you cosplay autism. Autistic guys live in their own heads. They don&rsquo;t run all over the place for parents or kids,&rdquo; another chimed in.</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get on board. Period.&rdquo;</p><p>Adam was starting to lose his temper. &ldquo;I need to get on board!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;My family is depending on me!&rdquo;</p><p>The soldiers raised their guns. &ldquo;Back off!&rdquo; they ordered. </p><p>Soldiers further away, who were not even paying attention to them or Adam before, turned their heads and threw accusatory glances at him.</p><p>Adam knew that he couldn&rsquo;t argue with them. He turned and walked away.</p><div class="npf_row"><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="766" data-orig-width="765"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ec33f9adf18a6109e17ad979ba142726/c2b76c43549d70fe-ad/s640x960/bc8ba8fd1f9c6ad78fdaf595875577bdffb80529.png" data-orig-height="766" data-orig-width="765" srcset="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ec33f9adf18a6109e17ad979ba142726/c2b76c43549d70fe-ad/s75x75_c1/04852f23ce2935725d31f5f154daf21e3e8dad32.png 75w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ec33f9adf18a6109e17ad979ba142726/c2b76c43549d70fe-ad/s100x200/5d145b6e2eed934b708e47f23b8ac9f9ea95aa6d.png 100w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ec33f9adf18a6109e17ad979ba142726/c2b76c43549d70fe-ad/s250x400/1e7e622e07022406794cdc5dc823de99f03c790d.png 250w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ec33f9adf18a6109e17ad979ba142726/c2b76c43549d70fe-ad/s400x600/d218f5f1ff55b12db852bb22af624e814c61b4b5.png 400w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ec33f9adf18a6109e17ad979ba142726/c2b76c43549d70fe-ad/s500x750/6d8727d27b00ed9a0687ae1b316fb7c16dcf0626.png 500w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ec33f9adf18a6109e17ad979ba142726/c2b76c43549d70fe-ad/s540x810/355b5ba8fece96b8b7a94ab52c77f91b5e9f4e2e.png 540w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ec33f9adf18a6109e17ad979ba142726/c2b76c43549d70fe-ad/s640x960/bc8ba8fd1f9c6ad78fdaf595875577bdffb80529.png 640w, https://64.media.tumblr.com/ec33f9adf18a6109e17ad979ba142726/c2b76c43549d70fe-ad/s1280x1920/9356b408032fdfdf1d9116bb7283bad5f4d7e261.png 765w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px"/></figure></div><p>Later that night, he was so worn out and frostbitten he huddled among trash bags in an alley behind a dilapidated power station, his chest heaving against the supplies. A string of fairy lights peeked out from one of the bags, its extinguished bulbs emptied of dreams.</p><p>Adam started to imagine the fairy lights powered on, glowing underwater and on the tiers of a musical fountain buttressed by statues of mythical guardians, but quickly punched himself in the head, the way his class monitor, flanked by bootlicking underlings, repeatedly did to him all those years ago. Why couldn&rsquo;t his identity be neat and simple? Be either the stereotypical autistic tech genius or a typical family man. Have either so-called autistic interests in some scientific or mathematical field or the skill to deceive himself and abandon his passion for interior design from the beginning. What sort of rational person would care about art and decoration when radiation was in your only meal of the day while tank guns pointed everywhere? </p><p>If he could just switch his interests and match them with economic logic as readily as nerds in old clips solved Rubik&rsquo;s Cube in a split second, he would be the one launching the stealth planes that must be gliding overhead right now, not a pathetic hitchhiker of a military lorry. His family would be cloistered away in one of those underground enclaves for the super wealthy, with all the aides and sitters they needed.</p><p>The red hazard sign on the drab wall opposite seemed to be glaring at Adam: We told you so. No, rewind that a second. How marvelous his aesthetic mind still had the luxury to judge the appeal of the power station, as if a red sign on some royal blue background could order food to automatically march into stomachs. </p><p>Adam&rsquo;s train of thoughts came to a halt. He had a brainwave.</p><p>Years later, a group of journalists felt like they were stepping into a dream as they navigated an office space filled with art and soothing music. There were little bulbs in shades of purple everywhere, glowing in the low-light conditions its creative employees preferred to work in. In the depths of the office were laboratories and showrooms with magenta lights in various stylistic arrangements. Below the lights were lettuces, cabbages, cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes and many other crops, some of which looked healthier than those grown under the sunlight of the pre-apocalypse years. The chlorophyll hungrily absorbed the different combinations of red and blue light tailored for the plants. The greatest value a design firm could bring to indoor agriculture, though, was optimization of lighting and area usage under the varying and challenging space conditions of post-apocalypse dwellings. Adam was feeding stomachs one fairy light at a time.</p><p>The old question popped up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the secret to your success?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a convenient, pared-down identity,&rdquo; Adam replied simply.</p><p><br/></p><p class="npf_quirky"><span class="npf_color_chandler">Credits</span></p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Story concept:</span> Human</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Story setting:</span> FierceOcean @ Character.ai</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Text: </span>Mostly Human + some AI input </p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Images: </span>Mostly Character.ai + some Human input</p><p><br/></p><p class="npf_quirky"><span class="npf_color_chandler">References</span></p><p><span class="npf_color_rachel">Liang, Y., Kang, C., Kaiser, E. </span><i><span class="npf_color_rachel">et al</span></i><span class="npf_color_rachel">.
