</p><p>&ldquo;Spit out the worm.&rdquo; </p><p>That line from <i>Six Flying Dragons</i> is what we want to tell this increasingly feverish, belligerent and senseless world now. Less than half a day after the previous post on counter-terrorism was released, yet another round of attacks made the headlines. When life is this fragile, there is all the more reason to treat ourselves and one another more kindly.</p><p>

The rest of this post and the title were meant as a preview of a <i>Tree With Deep Roots </i>post commemorating the end of <i>Six Flying Dragons</i>. A note of thanks to Tumblr bloggers for their support anyway.</p><p>Happy reading. And happy philosophizing on all things entomological.</p> </div>
