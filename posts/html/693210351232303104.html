How&rsquo;s the insurgency against the crowned microbe going? How has life been for the carpenter, you ask? Let&rsquo;s just say that, going by common experience, some things will only come to a fiery end. You can only slap on cooling balm here and there, now and then. Right now, the autistic lawyering series <b>Extraordinary Attorney Woo</b> (native title: Eccentric Attorney Woo Young Woo), currently ranked third place worldwide across all English and non-English language Netflix TV titles, is that balm for many subjects to that crown, with the soothing metaphors, dreamy people and atmosphere, and of course brilliantly rendered whales. But will this series remain just balm, while neurodivergent people continue to face the horrific violence detailed in studies, reports and real-life Asian(-American) autistic attorney Lydia X. Z. Brown&rsquo;s accounts? Do we believe the show, regardless of questions about the autistic acting? Can we afford to? Are we willing to give real-life Woos a chance at an upwardly mobile, complete life in this hectic and anxiety-ridden age? No amount of debate can settle these questions better than a democratic poll.</p><p>Everyone is warmly welcome to take part in this very short <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.surveymonkey.com%2Fr%2FW2ZLD8P&amp;t=MDQyZjZjNGJhNDVlMjQzNTgzMDk1YjA0NjdhNWZmYmJmMTQ5NDY0ZixkOTdkOTQ0YTU3N2FiOGQ2YWUzNDgyNGE5ODU0ZTU3YmUxMzRlZGIw&amp;ts=1661661130" target="_blank">one-month survey</a> which commenced yesterday. So far, thanks to some very kind friends, six people have submitted their answers, taking only an average of 1.5 minutes each. If you are unfamiliar with the show, you can still check it out before the deadline. Results will be published on this site only if there are at least 50 sets of answers. Spread the news around to see how many people share your sentiments!</p><p>Good luck to you and the Woos in your own lives! Let&rsquo;s all not forget what&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like to be truly human.</p>
