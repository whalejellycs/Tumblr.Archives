As players take their positions, the smell of old and rotten tomatoes hits our noses, and the sight of players dressed in animal costumes adds to the surrealism of the scene. The players hold their fabric rackets, ready for a game that&rsquo;s unlike any other.&rdquo;</p>[[MORE]]<p>&ldquo;As the first serve is made, the ball arcs in the air with a juicy splatter, and the spectators react with delight, laughing and cheering at the unusual spectacle before them. The players dance across the court, moving with agility and grace, using their fabric rackets to swat the tomatoes in all directions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look! The giraffe&rsquo;s tomato sails over the net and into the lion&rsquo;s court. The lion swings his racket, but he misses the tomato! The giraffe scores the first point.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The lion is not happy. He roars in anger and charges at the giraffe. The giraffe is scared, but he holds his ground. The lion leaps into the air and tries to swipe at the giraffe with his claws. But the giraffe ducks out of the way, and the lion lands on his face.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The crowd laughs. The lion is humiliated. He gets up and tries to hit the tomato, but he keeps missing. The giraffe wins two sets in a row, 6-0, 6-0.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As the game progresses, the players&rsquo; antics and shenanigans become more and more outrageous, with one player even taking a bite out of the tomato during a play. The crowd goes wild, cheering and clapping at every unexpected turn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After a hard-fought game, one player emerges victorious, holding a slice of tomato, their signature victory pose. The crowd erupts with applause, and the players take a bow, proud to have put on a performance that was not only entertaining but also offered a refreshing change from the traditional ball games where the ball is a clone standardized down to the millimeter level.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s a wrap on another batch of exciting matches! You have been watching <i>Splat!</i>, a wackosome tournament that convinces kids to step away from their screens and explore the wonder and magic of the world around us. Raw messiness is our biggest star. It&rsquo;s a great way for your future Olympians at home to learn how to deal with unexpected situations and how to laugh at themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your announcer for the day, Coco Reed. Over and ouch!&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p class="npf_quirky"><span class="npf_color_ross">Credits</span></p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Illustration:</span> AI1-AI2-AI1 (Although WOMBO did not contribute anything to the image concept or composition, it was instrumental to the refinement stage in the middle.)</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Narration:</span> AI3-AI4-AI3-AI4 (Approximation) + Human dubbing</p><p><span style="color: #ff4930">Game concept:</span> <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/ML3bZjjB_WAwvrxAkQTJznA" target="_blank">@tomatodiscourse</a> must have been an indirect source of inspiration.</p>
