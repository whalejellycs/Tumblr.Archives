Three styles of doing so are: 1) adding imaginary or speculated entities together or to real entities and checking the real outcomes, 2) adding real entities together and fancying imaginary outcomes and 3) aggregating entities and checking the outcomes within each entity. Not all makes sense, yet the sensibility or insensibility, popularity or unpopularity, of a mode of accounting does not affect its possibility among us humans, all vulnerable and flawed. For some fun applications, consider the prospects of socializing an empty universe or an indivisible monoparticle universe or thinking about universes we have speculative, imperfect or no knowledge of.</p><p>At its roots, regular addition comprises either or both of accumulation and contemplation, because it must take place at least in a physical, mental or temporal dimension. In an empty universe and a universe made up of an indivisible particle and nothing else, not even space, no matter or matter-space accumulation or metabolic process, which is really a series of matter interaction, can take place, making such addition on the physical dimension or in-world mental dimension impossible. The remaining mode of regular addition is that on a temporal dimension, wherein we add one second or some other time unit to another of the same kind. In the monoparticle universe, that may be a counter against which we trace any movement the particle may make across some bulk universe enveloping the universe. We have addressed the complications of time addition above.</p><p>But one way to execute non-temporal regular addition on social phobic universes like these all the same in the meantime is to superimpose imagined entities onto these universes and perform the addition from the comfort of a thoroughly addition-safe universe. Another is to consider a metaphysical mega universe, or perhaps that physical bulk universe, in which we count them up. However, our inputs would not yield any output within any of the universes. Each universe might as well ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; </p><p>Although this scenario may still look like a frivolous exercise to some of us, it has similar real-world counterparts, as when stellar gross domestic products do not equate individual economic survival. When the two ends of addition can lie in different places, sometimes justifiably (for the sake of justice comparison or productivity measurement, for example), 1+1=1 is a possibility. </p><p>When patchwork addition is applied to a hypothetical or imperfectly known universe, the equation can run in two directions. A universe or its added components may not exist (an empty set, in mathematical terms), or its ongoings may be beyond human imagination. In the latter scenario, an unanticipated 1+1 on its end may amount to 1 or, if the added components are not even known to exist, 0 in limited Earthling minds. That universe might be this one, right here, we are living in, with exoplanets potentially exceeding expectations and fellow planetary citizens accumulating woes unimaginable to many as they suffer cruelty beyond common knowledge and experience.</p><ul><li><b><span style="color: #ff4930">Meta</span></b><span class="npf_color_monica"><b>phors</b></span></li></ul><p>&ldquo;One plus one&rdquo; need not strictly be a mathematical expression.
